      <h1> Attack On Titan </h1>
      <h2> The Face OF Humanity's Extinction</h2>
      <p class="lead"> Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called
        titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly
        terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure.
        To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one
        hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal
        titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the
        man-eating abominations. </p>

            <h3 class="head">Season One </h3>
            <p>When our story begins, humans are already an endangered species. For over a hundred years, they have
              lived in fear of the Titans, a mysterious race of giant, animalistic humanoids that wander the world
              searching for people to devour. Nobody knows anything about these creatures or where they came from, and
              the small population that managed to escape the Titans' wrath unscathed have barricaded themselves within
              numerous towns, surrounded by three layers of sky-high stone walls. Life behind the walls is peaceful
              enough, but our protagonist, Eren Jaeger, yearns for the adventure and freedom afforded to the Scout
              Regiment, who are the only souls brave enough to combat Titans beyond the cities' walls. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 class="head"> Season Two </h3>
            <p> Five years pass, and our heroes have worked tirelessly to develop the skills needed to fight the Titans.
              Central to the militia's arsenal is the Omni-Directional Mobility Gear, a harness that combines numerous
              razor-sharp blades with multi-directional grappling hooks to provide soldiers with maximum mobility and
              speed. After mastering the difficult skill of zipping through the air with nothing but rapidly-fired
              cables, the soldiers are able to attack the Titans' only known weak spot: the nape of their neck, causing
              instant death when slashed deep enough. Eren is the most passionate and aggressive soldier in the corps,
              while Armin is an exceptional strategist, and MiKASA has become the strongest and deadliest cadet in the
              program. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 class="head">Season Three </h3>
            <p> It turns out the cadets won't have to wait long, because shortly after graduation, the Titans return to
              launch another offensive, led once again by the Colossal Titan. Despite the unit's years of training,
              these Titans are still formidable foes, and the soldiers are absolutely trounced in a matter of hours. In
              a desperate attempt to save Armin's life, even Eren is dismembered and devoured by a Titan at the very
              start of the battle.</p>
